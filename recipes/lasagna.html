    <h2>Summary</h2>
    
    <p>
        Lasagna is a hearty, layered Italian dish that combines rich flavors and comforting textures. It typically features wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with savory layers of seasoned ground meat or vegetables, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and tangy tomato sauce. Baked until bubbling and golden, the top layer is often crowned with melted mozzarella or Parmesan, adding a satisfying, slightly crispy finish. With its warm, indulgent taste and mouthwatering aroma, lasagna is a beloved classic that's perfect for family dinners, special occasions, or simply satisfying a serious comfort food craving.
