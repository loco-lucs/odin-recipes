    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>
        Baby back ribs are a popular cut of pork taken from the upper portion of the ribcage, near the spine, where the ribs are shorter and more curved. Known for their tenderness and leaner meat compared to spare ribs, baby back ribs are a favorite for grilling, smoking, or baking. When properly cooked, the meat becomes juicy and flavorful, easily pulling away from the bone. They are often seasoned with dry rubs or marinated before being slow-cooked and finished with a glaze of barbecue sauce for a rich, smoky-sweet taste. Their smaller size and succulent texture make them especially popular at barbecues and family gatherings.

    <p>
        <ol>

            <li>Remove the thin membrane from the back of the ribs for better tenderness.</li>
            <li>Pat the ribs dry with paper towels and apply a dry rub or marinade evenly.</li>
            <li>Wrap the ribs tightly in aluminum foil to retain moisture.</li>
            <li>Place the wrapped ribs on a baking sheet (if using an oven) or on indirect heat (if using a grill).</li>
            <li>Cook for 2.5 to 3 hours until the meat is tender and pulls away from the bone.</li>
            <li>Unwrap the ribs and brush them with barbecue sauce.</li>
            <li>Broil in the oven or grill over direct heat for 5–10 minutes to caramelize the sauce.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
